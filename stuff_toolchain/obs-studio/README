NOTES

Once you install the dependencies for obs-studio, you need to recompile ffmpeg
to pick up on "fdk-aac x264" then forcecompile osb-studio to gain ffmpeg's new
features.

If you have a GTX or RTX graphics card and are using "nvidia" install
"ffnvcodec-headers" and recompile ffmpeg for hardware nvenc video encoding.

Included is an example asound.conf.example file for capturing audio.
