# ALIASES(5)                                                          ALIASES(5)
#        o      An alias definition has the form
# 
#                    name: value1, value2, ...
# 
#        o      Empty lines and whitespace-only lines are  ignored,
#               as  are  lines whose first non-whitespace character
#               is a `#'.
# 
#        o      A logical line starts with non-whitespace  text.  A
#               line  that starts with whitespace continues a logi-
#               cal line.
# 
#        The name is a local address (no domain part).  Use  double
#        quotes  when the name contains any special characters such
#        as whitespace, `#', `:', or `@'. The  name  is  folded  to
#        lowercase, in order to make database lookups case insensi-
#        tive.
#        The value contains one or more of the following:
# 
#        address
#               Mail is forwarded to address, which  is  compatible
#               with the RFC 822 standard.
# 
#        /file/name
#               Mail  is  appended  to /file/name. See local(8) for
#               details of delivery to file.  Delivery is not  lim-
#               ited  to regular files.  For example, to dispose of
#               unwanted mail, deflect it to /dev/null.
# 
#        |command
#               Mail is piped into command. Commands  that  contain
#               special  characters,  such as whitespace, should be
#               enclosed between double quotes.  See  local(8)  for
#               details of delivery to command.
# 
#               When the command fails, a limited amount of command
#               output is mailed back  to  the  sender.   The  file
#               /usr/include/sysexits.h  defines  the expected exit
#               status codes. For example, use "|exit 67" to  simu-
#               late  a  "user  unknown"  error,  and  "|exit 0" to
#               implement an expensive black hole.
# 
#        :include:/file/name
#               Mail is sent to  the  destinations  listed  in  the
#               named file.  Lines in :include: files have the same
#               syntax as the right-hand side of alias entries.
# 
#               A  destination  can  be  any  destination  that  is
#               described in this manual page. However, delivery to
#               "|command" and /file/name is disallowed by default.
#               To  enable,  edit  the  allow_mail_to_commands  and
#               allow_mail_to_files configuration parameters.
