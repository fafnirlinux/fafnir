README for kodi


In order to allow Kodi to shutdown/suspend/hibernate the machine,
install dbus, polkit, consolekit, and upower and launch kodi like so:

	~/.xinitrc:

	exec ck-launch-session kodi

If using a window manager or desktop environment that uses polkit and
consolekit already, this is usually unnecessary.
