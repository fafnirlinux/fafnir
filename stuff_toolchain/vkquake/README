post-install

Quake has 4 episodes that are split into 2 files:

    pak0.pak: contains episode 1
    pak1.pak: contains episodes 2-4

These files aren't free to distribute, but pak0.pak is sufficient to run the game
and it's freely available via the shareware version of Quake.

Use 7-Zip or a similar file archiver to extract quake106.zip/resource.1/ID1/PAK0.PAK.
Alternatively, if you own the game, you can obtain both .pak files from its install media.

Create $HOME/.vkquake/id1, and copy pak0.pak (and pak1.pak, if you have it) there, e.g.:

.vkquake\id1\pak0.pak
.vkquake\id1\pak1.pak

Then vkQuake is ready to play.


Optional - Music / Soundtrack

The original quake had a great soundtrack by Nine Inch Nails. Unfortunately, the Steam version
does not come with the soundtrack files. The GOG-provided files need to be converted before they are ready for use.

In general, you'll just need to move a "music" folder to the correct location within
your vkQuake installation (.e.g .vquake/id1/music).

QuakeSpasm, the engine vkQuake is derived from, supports OGG, MP3, FLAC, and WAV audio formats.
The Linux version of QuakeSpasm/VkQuake requires external libraries: libogg or libvorbis for OGG support, libmad or libmpg123 for MP3, and libflac for FLAC.
If you already have a setup that works for the engine you're currently using, then you don't necessarily have to change it.

Generally, the below setup works for multiple engines, including Quakespasm/vkQuake:

- The music files are loose files, NOT inside a pak or pk3 archive.

- The files are placed inside a "music" subfolder of the "id1" folder.
     For missionpack or mod soundtracks, the files are placed in a "music" subfolder of the appropriate game folder.
     So the original Quake soundtrack files go inside "id1\music",
     Mission Pack 1 soundtrack files go inside "hipnotic\music",
     and Mission Pack 2 soundtrack files go inside "rogue\music".

- The files are named in the pattern "tracknn", where "nn" is the CD track number that the file was ripped from.
    Since the soundtrack starts at the second CD track, MP3 soundtrack files are named "track02.mp3", "track03.mp3", etc.
    OGG soundtrack files are named "track02.ogg", "track03.ogg", etc.
    FLAC soundtrack files are named "track02.flac", "track03.flac", etc.
    WAV soundtrack files are named "track02.wav", "track03.wav", etc.
