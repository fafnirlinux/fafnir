NOTES:
=====

* I have switched from generating the java cacerts to depending on p11-kit and
  make-ca. If you run into build failure at configure due to missing the java
  cacerts file, the likely issue is that `make-ca` needs to be run before
  building openjdk8. It will be done automatically when installing p11-kit, if:
    1) you have 'runscripts yes' in your prt-get.conf, or
    2) supply prt-get with '--install-scripts' commandline argument.

* These are the links to the unversioned files:

http://icedtea.wildebeest.org/download/drops/icedtea8/$icedtea_version/{corba,hotspot,jaxp,jaxws,langtools,nashorn,openjdk}.tar.xz

  The mirrorred and versioned files are merely renamed to prevent signature mismatches and files
  not being downloaded due to older, unversioned files stopping the correct file from being retrieved.

* The manual pages are outside of the normal MANPATH. At this point in time,
  I see no easy way to move them without conflicting with the opt/jdk port.

* These packages exist in my j_v repo (might be nice to have as dependencies):

  pcsc-lite, lksctp-tools

  (I need to determine if there is any actual benefit from depending on them).


TODO:
====

* Concider generic java packages that allow to have different java env installed
  and be able to switch between them via script:

  'java-choose openjdk8'

  or

  'java-choose jdk'

* Do testing beyond just running java programs like eclipse and minecraft.
  To this end, I now have a jtreg port.
