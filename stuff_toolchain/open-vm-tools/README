README for open-vm-tools

INTRODUCTION

This port contains VMware Tools.  You should install it if you are running CRUX
as a virtual machine under the VMware hypervisor.
This has only been tested on single core 32-bit virtual machines.
The VMware filesystem (vmhgfs) has not been tested.
Feedback is appreciated.

POST-INSTALL

1. Run the post-install script.
2. Add vmtools to the list of services to start at boot time.

FAQ

Q: What is the difference between this and the official commercial VMware Tools
   distribution?

A: This code comes from the GPL release of VMware's tools, so in theory
   it should work just as the commercial version.
   That said, since this port is intended to be used on a server environment,
   all the desktop utilities have been removed (eg: no GUI applications).

Q: Where is the driver for the VMware network adapter and disk controller?

A: Some device drivers are already included in the Linux kernel and disabled
   in this port.
   Please enable these kernel options:
   * CONFIG_VMWARE_BALLOON
   * CONFIG_VMWARE_PVSCSI
   * CONFIG_VMXNET3
   If your boot filesystem is connected to a paravirtual SCSI interface make
   sure CONFIG_VMWARE_PVSCSI is set as builtin instead of module.


Q: Why do I have to shutdown/reboot twice my VM from VMware before it reacts?

A: Did you run the post-install script?
