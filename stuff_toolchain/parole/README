NOTES

        Parole upstream developers marked gst-plugins-good as an *optional*
        dependency, however it is required on runtime and it crashes
	immediately if gst-plugins-good is not installed.

	To avoid that *optional* issue, this port must require gst-plugins-good
        which is part of contrib repository, so maybe you'll need to enable it.
